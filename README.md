# Challenge-18-Social-Network-API

It is safe to say that social media is one of, if not, the biggest market for web development. This is because virtually everything is now driven by social media, in one way or another. Given this, we have been tasked with developing a properly functioning set of web API's and backend for a new social media platform. Due to the dynamic and evolutionary nature of social media, we will be using NoSQL, Mongoose and MongoDB to handle all of our database requests, so that our code is flexible with the projected growth of our platform. 

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
